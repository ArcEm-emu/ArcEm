Building arcem for different platforms


Unix:

  Edit the Makefile, and uncomment the default "System=X".
  Comment any other "System=" lines.
  Run 'make'


RISC OS for X:

  N.B.  This is not the recommended option - it is only mentioned
        because it is possible.

  You'll require !RiscXLib from Leo White's homepage:
  http://www.brighteyes.u-net.com/RiscXLib/RiscXLib.html
  Edit Makefile as per Unix.
  The program should build with GCC with 'make' distributed with it.


RISC OS Single Tasking:

  This is the default build option.
  The program should build with GCC with 'make' distributed with it.


RISC OS Desktop version:

  This is not yet supported.


Cross compiled RISC OS versions:

  As for the native builds, but invoke make with (for example):

    CC=/home/riscos/cross/bin/gcc make
