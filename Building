Building arcem for different platforms
Peter Naulls - peter@chocky.org


Unix:

  Edit the Makefile, and uncomment the default "System=X".
  Comment any other "System=" lines.
  Run 'make'


RISC OS for X:

  N.B.  This is not the recommended option - it is only mentioned
        because it is possible.

  You'll require !RiscXLib from Leo White's homepage:
  http://www.brighteyes.u-net.com/RiscXLib/RiscXLib.html
  Edit Makefile as per Unix.
  The program should build with GCC with 'make' distributed with it.


RISC OS Single Tasking:

  This is the default build option.
  The program should build with GCC with 'make' distributed with it.

  This version has two modes of operation.  The default is "Direct
  Display", where writes are mapped directly to the screen and
  the host machine matches the emulator's screen mode.  The alternative
  is to cache writes as per the X version, and run in mode 31.  This
  is controlled by the DIRECT_DISPLAY setting in the Makefile.


RISC OS Desktop version:

  This is not yet supported.


Cross compiled RISC OS versions:

  As for the native builds, but invoke make with (for example):

    CC=/home/riscos/cross/bin/gcc make
