Arcem Modes
-----------

ArcemModes is an extension module written for the Arcem Archimdes emulator it
provides a range of wimpmodes (screen resolutions) in addition to those built
into RISC OS. Sources of inspiration for modes come from the Virtual A5000
emulator and my own imagination.

YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS MODULE WITH ANY REAL ACORN MACHINE
only eumlators, this is due to some of the modes being beyond the capabilities
of the real VIDC hardware.

Here are the modes it provides
------------------------------

Virtual A5000 compatibilty modes
Mode     XRes YRes BPP Colours
 32       800  600   8     256

100      1024  768   1       2
101      1024  768   2       4
102      1024  768   4      16

104      1280 1016   1       2  (In VA5000 this is a clone of 105, but I
                                 thought that was probably a mistake and
                                 made it 1bpp)
105      1280 1016   2       4

108      1152  864   1       2
109      1152  864   2       4

112      1400  520   4      16  (Interlaced will be 1400 x 1040)

120      1600  600   4      16  (Interlaced will be 1600 x 1200)

PDA style modes (I wanted to see what RISC OS would look like on an iPaq)
122       240  320   1       2  (Slightly buggy)
123       240  320   2       4
124       240  320   4      16
125       240  320   8     256

Developing and assembling
-------------------------

The ArcemModes module in assembled from the BBC Basic file MakeModes
and can be assembled using any RISC OS Computer (though has only been tested
on RISC OS 3 and higher) or emulated RISC OS computer, including Arcem itself.
It is hoped in future that we can write a module can be written to generate
modes on the fly allowing arbitrary sizes and colour depths (within the 480k
screen memory limit).

Technical Details
-----------------

The extension mode service call, called when RISC OS does not recognise
the mode number a user has requested, expects 2 tables of data too be returned
(if the requested mode is one your module supports). One table is a list
VIDC parameters that corespond to the control registers on the VIDC chip, and
program such things as border width, and various other low level details. More
information can be found in the VIDC1 datasheet as to the exact meanings of
each register. The other table of data contains higher level information on
many things such as resolution, bpp, text resolution, max colours etc.

The data for both of these tables can be automatically generated from just
a X, Y and BPP value by the BBC BASIC program ModeGen. ModeGen contains all
the formulas we derived for calculating the tables of data.

ModeGen cannot yet create modes with rectangular pixels (or any mode whose
eigen values are not 1:1) and has some limitations with regards to directly
cut and pasting the results into MakeArcemModes. Please see the comments
at the top of ModeGen for more details.
