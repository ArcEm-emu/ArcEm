<h3>ChangeLog:</h3>

<p></p>

<dl>
 <dd>
  <p><b>1.00 - 6th May 2002</b></p>

  <ul>
   <li>New manual and new SourceForge page.  Other documentation deprecated.
   <li>Added project files for MS VC++, and fix warnings provoked by it.
   <li>Further split of windowing/non-windowing functionality to
       aid division of architecture-independent files.
   <li>Windows version made independent from Cygwin.    
   <li>Windows support imported from eQRD version.  Features brought
       inline with other versions, including icon change, and
       same format for choices file.
   <li>Entirety of build warnings fixed under GCC, including those
       that appeared from turning on harsh warning flags.
   <li>General tidying.    
   <li>Makefile rearranged so that default Unix builds are more sensible.
  </ul> 
 </dd>

 <dd>
  <p><b>0.60 - 30th September 2001</b></p>

  <ul>
   <li> Support for running RISC OS, by Alex Macfarlane Smith and Peter Naulls
   <li>  Split of the windowing aspects of the code, to allow independent
        development.
   <li> Some small speed ups.
   <li> Source code tidying and warning fixes.

<h3>Installation and Usage:</h3>

<p>The emulator is initially configured for one MFM hard disc.  If you
wish to change that, you will need to edit the arcemrc file.</p>

<p>To make a useful program, you will have to add to this the file "ROM"
containing an Operating System ROM to your OS set up below.  You may also have a
drive image file named "HardImage1".  This can either usefully be a RISC&nbsp;OS
filecore image or Linux ext2 image.  Note that RISC&nbsp;OS will quite
happily boot without a harddrive.</p>


<h4>Windows</h4>

<dl>
 <dd>
  <p><b>Warning: ARM Linux does not currently work in the Windows version
     of the emulator.  There is an unknown issue with harddrive access.</b></p>

  <p>Unpack the archive to a location of your choice. You should have
     the following files:</p>

  <ul>
   <li>index.html, maual.html - Documentation.
   <li>ArcEm.exe - The emulator itself.
   <li>hexcmos - CMOS settings for the emulator.
   <li>arcemrc - Configuration file.
  </ul>

  <p>The emulator is started by running the executable.  Unfortunately,
  if anything goes wrong, the emulator will simply quit with little or no
  warning.  This will be improved in future versions.
  </p>

  <p>
  Pressing the + key on the keypad will toggle display of the Windows
  mouse.
  </p>

 </dd>
</dl>


<h4>RISC OS</h4>

<dl>
 <dd>
   <p>Please see the !Help file within the !ArcEm application for usage
      information.
   </p>
 </dd>
</dl>


<h4>Unix</h4>

<dl>
 <dd>
   <p>Copy the arcemrc file to your home directory as .arcemrc.  Usage is
     otherwise similar to the Windows notes, but with some output on
     a console.</p>

   <p>
     As for the Windows version, pressing the + key on the keypad will
     capture the mouse.
   </p>
 </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Known Issues:</h3>

<ul>
 <li>The only menu item that does anything in Windows is Quit.
 <li>The mouse handling in Windows is rather poor. 
 <li>The Windows version has no diagnostics if anything goes wrong
     (unless you rebuild with a console).
 <li>The RISC OS version is very slow.
 <li>The X-Windows version has no size handling - you have to resize
     the window manually.
</ul>

<h3>Quick FAQ:</h3>

<p><i><b>Q. Can ArcEm run RISC&nbsp;OS 3.5 or later?</b></i></p>

<p><b>A.</b> No.  ArcEm only emulates Archimedes-style hardware.  RiscPC-style
hardware is required for RISC&nbsp;OS 3.5 or later.  I have no plans
to add this, due to the time and research involved, but if someone else
wanted to, I would be happy to help.</p> 

<p><i><b>Q. Where can I get RISC&nbsp;OS 3.1 ROMs?</b></i></p>

<p><b>A.</b> From your A5000, A3020, etc.  ROM images obtained from
any other source may be of questionable legality.  This topic has been
discussed at length in various forums, and will not be repeated here.</p>

<p>To save ROMs from your machine, use four 720K DOS formatted floppies (or
1.44MB if your machine supports it) and use the following commands for
each floppy:</p>

<pre>
       *save :0.$.ROM1 3800000 3880000
       *save :0.$.ROM2 3880000 3900000
       *save :0.$.ROM3 3900000 3980000
       *save :0.$.ROM4 3980000 3a00000
</pre> 

<p>Finally, ArcEm requires that the ROM image be a single file (unlike
the other emulators), so concatenate the files using your favourite method
to produce the final file.
</p>


<p><i><b>Q. It doesn't do anything when it starts/feature X doesn't seem to work?</b></i></p>

<p><b>A.</b> Recompile it with debugging turned on, and find out why.
I don't have a better answer than that for the time being if you
can't make it work.</p>
