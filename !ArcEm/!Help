This is completely experimental, and horribly slow, and not supported.
However, you can boot RISC OS and ARM Linux on it.




Installing:

  You will require the !Unixhome application.  This is available from
  http://www.chocky.org/unix/programs/
  Put the file /arcemrc inside !UnixHome (double click on it)
  Put the !ArcEm application anywhere you like along with the 'ROM'
  file.


Running ARM Linux:

  The provided 'ROM' file will boot ARM Linux.  However, to get further
  than a kernel panic, you will require the Harddrive image from
    ftp://ftp.arm.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/arcem/
  Uncompress, and also place in the same dir as !ArcEm.
  Run the application.
  Login as "root".


Running RISC OS:

  You'll need to obtain a RISC OS 3.1 (or whatever) ROM image.  If you
  have 4 files, you'll need to join these into a 2MB file called "ROM"
  in the same directory as !ArcEm.
  Run the application.
  Enjoy.


You can quit the emulator with the escape key.

Known Problems:

  Hardware scrolling (e.g. F12 from desktop) doesn't work properly.
  It's very slow.
  Escape key quits, rather than sending escape to emulator (need a suitable
  key combination to quit emulator).
