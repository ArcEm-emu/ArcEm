ArcEm: Archimedes Emulator                               http://arcem.sf.net/
=============================================================================

Version 1.50.2


Requirements
------------

+ A suitable ROM image. See below for details.
+ Iyonix or better (ARMv5+ CPU).
  BeagleBoard-xM recommended for best performance.
+ Somewhere between 8MB and 64MB of RAM, depending on options
+ SharedSound if you want sound
+ SharedUnixLibrary


ROM images
----------

ArcEm is known to be compatible with both RISC OS (3.1 and below) and ARM
Linux ROM images. A suitable ARM Linux ROM image can be downloaded from the
ArcEm website:

    http://arcem.sf.net/

RISC OS ROM images can be obtained from two sources:

+ Making a copy of the ROMs found in a real machine. See !ArcEm.manual/htm
  for details.
+ Buying the "RISC OS Classic ROM Collection CD" from RISCOS Ltd:
  http://www.riscos.com/

Once you have your ROM image, save it as the file 'ROM' within !ArcEm.


Quiting the emulator
--------------------

ArcEm passes almost all keypresses straight through to the emulated machine.
Therefore Escape, F12, Ctrl-Break, etc. won't allow you to quit the emulator.
Instead, you must use one of the following methods:

1. Quit via the tweak menu (see below for how to access)
2. Quit via Alt-Break
3. Use the builtin SWI ArcEm_Shudown (SWI &56AC0)


HostFS
------

When running RISC OS 2 or RISC OS 3, any files placed in the 'hostfs' folder
will be accessible by the emulated machine. This is usually the best way of
getting files into and out of the emulator. However not all software will
work with HostFS (e.g. Lemmings 2), so you may also want to make use of
floppy and/or hard disc images where appropriate.


Floppy disc images
------------------

ArcEm supports the use of up to four emulated floppy drives, via the use of
standard .adf floppy images. Place your images in the same directory as
!ArcEm, with names such as FloppyImage0, FloppyImage1, FloppyImage2, etc.
Floppies can be made write-protected by making the file read-only. Note that
there's currently no way of swapping floppies while in the emulator, and
1600K images aren't supported.


Hard disc images
----------------

ArcEm is able to use ST506 hard disc images, see the "Hard disc parameters"
section for more details.


Configuration
-------------

The RISC OS version of ArcEm currently lacks any configuration frontend.
Instead, configuration is performed in three places:

1. Specifying command line parameters in the !ArcEm.!Run file
2. Specifying hard disc parameters in the !ArcEm./arcemrc file
3. Adjusting display settings at runtime via the tweak menu


Command line parameters
-----------------------

--rom <value>

  Used to specify the location of the ROM image

--extnromdir <value>

  Used to specify the location of the extension ROMs

--hostfsdir <value>

  Used to specify the location of the hostfs directory

--memory <value>

  Used to specify how much memory to emulate. Valid values are:

  512K, 1M, 2M, 4M (default), 8M, 12M, 16M

--processor <value>

  Used to specify the processor type emulate. Valid values are:

  ARM2, ARM250 (default), ARM3

--display <value>

  Select the display driver to use on startup. Valid values are:

  pal (default), std

  'pal' selects the palettised display driver, which uses the least amount
  of memory and provides the best performance. However it doesn't support the
  use of mid-frame palette swaps (as used by games such as Lotus II &
  Lemmings 2). For these games it's recommended you use the 'std' driver.

--rbswap

  Swap red & blue in 16bpp mode (e.g. for Iyonix with GeForce FX)

--nolowcolour

  Prevent ArcEm from trying to use 1/2/4bpp modes. Recommended for Iyonix
  users with Aemulor running (it's quicker for ArcEm to use an 8bpp mode
  directly than to go via Aemulor's low-colour emulation)

--noaspect

  Disable aspect ratio correction

--noupscale

  Disable upscaling. Recommended for best performance.

--minres <x> <y>

  Specify minimum screen resolution to use. Any modes with a resolution lower
  than this won't be used by ArcEm. Use this to filter out any low-res modes
  (e.g. 320x256) which have entries in your MDF but don't really work
  properly with your monitor.

--lcdres <x> <y>

  Specify the native resolution of your monitor. If specified, ArcEm will
  only ever use screen modes that will scale perfectly to fit your monitor,
  so you won't have ugly LCD scaling artifacts.

--menukeys <a> <b>

  Specify the key numbers of the two keys used to access the tweak menu. These
  are "low-level internal key numbers" - for a reference, see the ROOL wiki:

  http://www.riscosopen.org/wiki/documentation/show/Low-Level%20Internal%20Key%20Numbers

  Default values are 104 and 105 (left & right Windows keys).


Hard disc parameters
--------------------

Hard disc parameters are specified in the !ArcEm./arcemrc file. The file
should contain entries of the form:

MFM disc
<drive> <numcyl> <numheads> <numsect> <reclength>

Where:
  <drive> is the drive number (0-3),
  <numcyl> is the number of cylinders,
  <numheads> is the number of heads,
  <numsect> is the number of sectors, and
  <reclength> is the record (i.e. sector) length.

Note that RISC OS only ever uses drive numbers 1 and 2.

Note that after creating or modifying an entry, it's important to remember
to make sure that the relevant disc image file exists and is the correct
size. The image files are located within !ArcEm and named 'HardImage0',
'HardImage1', etc. An easy way to create an image of the correct size is to
use the *Create command (from within the host OS). For example, the
default /arcemrc file contains the following:

MFM disc
1 612 4 32 256

This defines HardImage1 as being a 20MB hard disc image. An appropriate
blank image can be created as follows (Where '1320000' is the result of
612*4*32*256, in hex):

*Create <ArcEm$Dir>.HardImage1 1320000

Remember that modifying the parameters of an existing image will most likely
result in the loss of all data.


The tweak menu
--------------

The tweak menu can be accessed by simultaneously pressing both Windows keys
on the keyboard. This menu allows you to change the following options:

+ Switch between the two display drivers (--display command line option)
+ Toggle red/blue swapping in 16bpp modes (--rbswap command line option)
+ Control the display driver performance options (see below)
+ Enable/disable aspect ratio correction & upscaling (--noaspect and
  --noupscale options)
+ Enable the ability to take screenshots when Print Screen is pressed.
  Screenshots will be saved to the directory !ArcEm is in.
+ Toggle the display of some stats to the top-left corner of the screen.
  The stats show (from left to right):
  - The emulator performance in MHz
  - The resolution, refresh rate, and bits-per-pixel of the Arc display
  - The display scale factors
  - The estimated framerate of whichever game is running
  Note that games or software which doesn't make use of multiple screen
  banks will report a framerate of zero. If the UpdateFlags option is on,
  the framerate counter will also drop if the frameskip value is set too
  high (since you will no longer be seeing all the frames that the software
  is attempting to display).

To resume the emulator from the tweak menu, press 'R'. To quit the emulator,
press 'Q'.

The --menukeys command line option can be used to change which keys are used
to open the menu (e.g. if your keyboard doesn't have both Windows keys).


Display driver performance options
--------------------------------

As mentioned above, there are several options available in the tweak menu to
help boost the performance of the display driver. These options are:

  "Display auto UpdateFlags"

    Setting this to "On" will boost the performance of many games. However it
    may not work properly with some games/software (screen updates may be
    somewhat irratic), so by default it's set to "Off".

  "Display uses UpdateFlags", "Display frameskip"

    If the "auto UpdateFlags" option is on, these options will be set and
    adjusted automatically by the emulator, and must be left alone.

    If the "auto UpdateFlags" option is off, you can set these values
    manually to fine-tune performance. Briefly, the UpdateFlags option
    controls whether ArcEm redraws the entire screen or only the changed
    areas. Turning it on selects the latter, but causes some memory writes
    to have a significant performance overhead, since ArcEm must track all
    writes to screen memory. In games which make use of multiple screen
    banks, it's usually best to turn this option off, as it will avoid the
    unnecessary performance penalty of tracking memory writes (since the
    entire screen will have to be redrawn each time the game switches
    screen banks). However if the option is off the correct frameskip value
    must be set otherwise you won't see any performance benefits.

    The frameskip option behaves slightly differently depending on whether
    the UpdateFlags option is on or off. If the UpdateFlags option is on,
    the frameskip value acts like the frameskip value you'd find in any other
    emulator. A value of 0 causes the screen to be updated every frame; 1
    causes it to be updated every 2nd frame, etc. E.g. if you're in a 50Hz
    screen mode, and a game is running at 25fps, a frameskip value of 1 will
    give you a slight performance boost without hurting framerate. Values
    of 2 or more will give greater performance boosts, but will result in the
    screen being redrawn less often.

    If the UpdateFlags option is off, then there are generally two situations
    in which the screen will be redrawn: when the running game switches to a
    different screen bank, or when the frameskip counter runs down. Assuming
    the game keeps running and keeps swapping screen banks, the frame skip
    counter is irrelevant, as it will never run down. However if the game
    stops running, or switches to a mode where it doesn't use multiple screen
    banks (e.g. in menu screens) the screen will stop being redrawn. This is
    where the frameskip counter becomes important. If you're in a 50Hz mode,
    and the game is running at 25fps, a frameskip counter of 2 would likely
    be the most appropriate. This means that ArcEm will only force the screen
    to be redrawn if the framerate drops to below 17fps. 


Other notes/known issues
------------------------

+ If your monitor complains about a bad signal, or the screen is distorted,
  etc. then it's probable that ArcEm is trying to use a screen mode that your
  monitor doesn't support. Check your MDF and remove modes that don't
  function correctly, or use the --minres option to prevent ArcEm from trying
  to use the bad modes.

+ Sound may break up if there are sudden changes in emulator
  load/performance, or when performing slow operations via HostFS

+ Sound quality isn't great if ArcEm has to mix down to a lower sample rate

+ Music tempo tends to fluctuate a bit with some music players.

+ Sometimes there'll be a lot of audio lag, which doesn't clear up, even
  after a few seconds. Opening & closing the tweak menu should fix it.

+ If the emulator can't find a suitable screen mode, it will quit.

+ Software which adjusts the size of the display/border areas might not look
  correct.

+ If the display is being scaled, the mouse pointer image may not always be
  scaled correctly, or (due to improper scaling) the hotspot may not be in
  the correct position.

+ Formatting floppies seems to be broken.

+ Empty floppy drives aren't emulated correctly.
