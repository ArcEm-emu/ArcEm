      <p>
        ArcEm is an emulator for the Acorn Archimedes A400 series machines.  It is not as well known
        as its two rivals, Red Squirrel and Archie.  This page hopes to rectify that.  Unlike them,
        ArcEm is open source, and runs on platforms besides Windows.  Contrary to belief, ArcEm
        is not new.  It has been around since at least 1998, and possibly a fair bit
        longer than that.
      </p>

      <p>
        ArcEm can successfully run both Acorn's RISC&nbsp;OS 3.11 (and
        earlier) and ARM Linux.
        A ROM and disk image for the latter is provided.
      </p>

      <p>
        ArmEm is distributed under the GPL.
      </p>

       <b>Before asking any questions or wondering what has gone wrong, please

          There's a good chance your question is already answered in there.

      <h3>About the versions on different platforms</h3>

      <p>
       The development history below is historical.  All versions
       are now maintained wholly by Peter Naulls.</a>
      </p>

      <p><b>X-Windows:</b></p>

      <dl>
       <dd>
         This was the original platform for the emulator, developed by Dr. Dave Gilbert.
         The emulator runs under Unix (including x86 Linux, ARM Linux and Mac OS X) using
         the facilities of X-Windows.
       </dd>
      </dl>

      <p><b>RISC&nbsp;OS:</b></p>

      <dl>
       <dd>
         ArcEm can run on later RISC OS machines such as StrongARM RiscPCs.  This support
         was written by Alex Macfarlane Smith, with help by Ian Jeffray and Peter Naulls.
         Unsurprisingly, it is very slow.  Perhaps in future, the emulator will be able
         to use the native processor.  The emulator only runs full-screen at present.
       </dd>
      </dl>

      <p><b>Windows:</b></p>

      <dl>
       <dd>
         In a seperate effort, ArcEm support for Win32 was developed by <a href="http://www.eqrd.net/">eQRD</a>.
         This has now been integrated back into this version by Peter Naulls.
         The Windows GUI for ArcEm is primitive and would benefit from an
         experienced Windows programmer.

<h3>Obtaining ArcEm</h3>

<p>ArcEm may be <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=36764">retrieved via CVS</a> from
SourceForge. The module name is 'arcem'.  The tag "version_100" references the current
release version.</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=36764">Binary versions</a>
 are available for x86 Linux, RISC&nbsp;OS, and Windows.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Using ArcEm</h3>

<p>Full usage information and ChangeLog are available in the
<a href="manual.html">manual</a>. 

<p>As distributed, ArcEm is set up to boot an ARM Linux ROM with
a disc image.  It can also boot RISC&nbsp;OS 3.1 ROMs.  Do <b>NOT</b>
ask me for a ROM image.  I am not able to supply you with it.  Anyone
doing so will be burnt at the stake.
</p>


<hr>

<h3>Issues with ArcEm</h3>

<p>
 Unfortunately, my time is very limited.  I will not be able to respond to any
 bug reports <i>unless</i> they are also accompanied by a source patch to fix the bug.
 This may sound harsh, but I would rather avoid disappointment by being up front.
 If your problem is insurmountable, I recommend you stick with one of the other emulators.
</p> 

<p>
 The Windows ArcEm GUI has many deficiencies - please don't email me about them,
 as I'm well aware of them.  Someone may have the enthusiasm to improve this.
</p>

<h3>Building ArcEm</h3>

<p>
  Please tell me if you cannot get ArcEm to build using these instructions, or
  if there are build failures.
</p>

<p><b>X-Windows:</b></p>

<dl>
 <dd>
   With X development libraries installed, ArcEm should build out of the box.  The
   exception is if you have a big-endian system, in which case you need to make
   a small change to the Makefile (documented near the top). 
 </dd>
</dl>


<p><b>RISC OS:</b></p>

<dl>
 <dd>
   ArcEm builds with GCC.  You should use the following command:

   <pre>

     make SYSTEM=riscos-single
   </pre>

   It is possible to build with Leo White's RiscXLib if you really want to make
   an X Windows version under RISC&nbsp;OS, but that is beyond the scope of this guide.
   Finally, it is also possible to cross compile it using
   <a href="http://hard-mofo.dsvr.net/gcc/">GCCSDK</a>. e.g.:

   <pre>

     CC=/home/riscos/cross/bin/gcc make SYSTEM=riscos-single
   </pre>

   The desktop version of ArcEm has not been developed yet, and will not build.

 </dd>
</dl>


<p><b>Windows:</b></p>

<dl>
 <dd>
   ArcEm will build under <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">Cygwin</a>.
   It builds a version which is indepedent of Cygwin (unlike the previous version of
   ArcEm for Windows), so you will also need to ensure you have mingw-runtime library installed
   (from Cygwin setup).  Use the following command:

   <pre>

     make SYSTEM=win
   </pre>

   Additionally, ArcEm will build in VC++.  Project files are provided for this in
   the 'vc' directory.  My experience with VC++ is limited, so forgive any follies.
 </dd>
</dl>
