Hi,

Here's an allocation request related to the !ArcEm Archimedes Hardware
Emulator.  A little background:  !ArcEm is the emulator application
which can be run under RISC OS itself.  The ArcEm module provides hooks
into the emulator from within the emulated RISC OS, e.g. a SWI to cause
the emulator to exit.

Thanks,


Ralph.
