This is the README file for ARMulator version 1.0, an ARM6 instruction 
emulator.

Configuration:
	The armulator has one configuration option, the default endianness
	of the processor.  This can be changed by building with ENDIAN=BIGEND
	to produce a big-endian variant.  The debugger can also select the
	endianness at run-time.

Build instructions:

	This program is known to compile using GCC 2.6.0 on a Sun4.  Other
	builds are untested.  It almost certainly will not work on non-32bit
	machines.

	To build the program simply type make in the source directory,
	followed by "make install"

Using the emulator:

	The emulator runs as a separate process, and communicates with a 
	debugger via tcp.  To start the emulator type
		armul <socknum>
	where socknum is any number between 1024 and 65535.  If the socket is
	already in use, armul will exit with an error.

	This version of armul has been designed to work with gdb-4.13
	with the ARM/RDP/RDI extensions added (available separately).  To
	connect gdb to the ARMulator, start gdb and type
		target arm <hostname>:<socknum>
	where hostname is the name of the machine on which the armulator
	is running, and socknum is the socket number specified when armul
	was started.
